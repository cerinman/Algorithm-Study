#Quick sort is O(n 2) at worst but for some datasets it can
#actually behave more like O(n log n).  This is typically
#because of the size of the dataset.  The smaller the dataset
#the better Quick sort will perform.  It is also worth noting
#that quick sort does much better if the first pivot chosen
#for comparison is some where in the median of the array.
