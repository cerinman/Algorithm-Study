// Object, method, property
/*
  Objects are nouns
*/

// Class
/*
  Blueprint
  Classic OO language:
  Create me a new object called Bob which is of class Person

  Javascript:
  Take this object Person that I have laying around,
  and reuse it as a prototype for a new object that I'll call Bob.

// Encapsulation
/*
  Encapsulation illustrates the fact that an object contains both:
  - data via properties
  - Means to do something with the data via methods
*/

// Aggregation / Composition
/*
  Combining several objects into a new one
*/

// Reusability / inheritance


// Polymorphism
